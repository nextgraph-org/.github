## NextGraph

### NextGraph brings about the convergence between P2P and Semantic Web technologies, towards a decentralized, secure and privacy-preserving cloud, based on CRDTs. 

This open source ecosystem provides solutions for end-users and software developers alike, wishing to use or create **decentralized** apps featuring: live collaboration on rich-text documents, peer to peer communication with end-to-end encryption, offline-first, local-first, portable and interoperable data, total ownership of data and software, security and privacy. Centered on repositories containing **semantic data (RDF)**, rich text, and structured data formats like **JSON**, synced between peers belonging to permissioned groups of users, it offers strong eventual consistency, thanks to the use of operation-based **CRDTs**. Documents can be linked together, signed, shared securely, queried using the **SPARQL** language and organized into sites and containers. 

Long-term goals include developing or integrating wikis, knowledge bases, search engines, groupware, productivity tools, supply chain solutions, marketplaces and e-commerce solutions, social networks, smart contracts and DAOs. 

With NextGraph, users can now create and access freely their own **interlinked data graphs**, while preserving privacy, security, data locality, and interoperability.
